# What is this place?

So... why start a blog you don't expect anyone to read? 

I want this to be a place where I can explore ideas and solidify them. 

I have often heard that writing is a way to take abstract ideas and make them concrete. As they find their way onto the page they become solid, or they fall apart. It is a surefire way to figure out whether you understand something.

I think too much. It's difficult to capture the thoughts I have daily, but if I have a thought consistently throughout the week then it should be captured. I would like a place where I can save those consistent thoughts and explore them further. Whether anyone reads them later, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that I learn through the experience.

I plan to sit down every weekend, set myself a timer for 60 minutes, and publish whatever comes out of it. I got this idea from [Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/coming-soon?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) whom I admire. It is the perfect way to ensure that my thoughts are captured regularly without putting too much pressure on myself.

*Let's see if I can make at least 10 of them.*
