# "Standard" pace

While listening to [The Tim Ferris Show](https://tim.blog/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/) this week, [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) said something I have been quietly thinking about for a long time.

> The standard pace is for chumps

In large institutions there are usually performance benchmarks you must hit to meet or exceed expectations. Those benchmarks are generally laughably low. The problem with a big organization is that they have to set the "Meets expectations" bar at a level that most people can reasonably meet without burning out. This means the bar is generally skewed much lower than it should be and presents the perfect opportunity to excel.

For a high-performing person, this means that by simply showing up and putting in minimal effort you can usually exceed expectations and become one of the top performers. The scary thing about this is that it is easy to allow effort to fall to the lowest possible level that meets expectations. If everyone is patting you on the back for just showing up, why try harder and risk doing extra work for nothing?

Because it is the moments you push yourself beyond those mediocre expectations that you actually learn. Not only do you learn but by blowing people's expectations out of the water you become an invaluable team member. You start gaining more responsibility and therefore more opportunity. Unreasonable success is created by consistently exceeding expectations.

Don't let big, slow organizations lead you to believe that *you need X years of experience* to reach that position, or that *it takes X years* to graduate. 

*Those benchmarks were set for the chumps.*
